# Algorithemic-Thinking-with-Python
## AIM
Write a Python program that performs the following tasks using the five basic arithmetic operators.

## User Input

- Ask the user to enter two numbers: `num1` and `num2`.
- Ask the user to enter a third number: `num3`.

## Operations

1. **Addition**  
   Add the first two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).  
   Print the sum in the format:  
   `The sum of num1 and num2 is: result`

2. **Subtraction**  
   Subtract `num2` from `num1`.  
   Print the difference in the format:  
   `The difference when num2 is subtracted from num1 is: result`

3. **Multiplication**  
   Multiply `num1` by `num2`.  
   Print the product in the format:  
   `The product of num1 and num2 is: result`

4. **Division**  
   Divide `num1` by `num2`.  
   Print the quotient in the format:  
   `The quotient when num1 is divided by num2 is: result`

5. **Modulus**  
   Find the remainder when `num1` is divided by `num2`.  
   Print the remainder in the format:  
   `The remainder when num1 is divided by num2 is: result`

## Python Program to Create, Concatenate, and Access a Sub-string

## Task
Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

1. Create two separate strings:
   - The first string should contain your first name.
   - The second string should contain your last name.

2. Concatenate the two strings with a space in between and store the result in a new variable.

3. Print the concatenated string.

4. From the concatenated string:
   - Access and print a sub-string that consists of the last name only using string slicing.

## Example

- If the first name is `"John"` and the last name is `"Doe"`, the concatenated string should be `"John Doe"`.
- The sub-string should be `"Doe"`.

## Working with Date and Time in Python

## Aim
To display the current date and time in various formats using Python's `datetime` module.

## Introduction

In Python, the `datetime` module provides classes for manipulating dates and times. The `strftime()` method is used to format dates and times into specific string representations, and `strptime()` can be used to parse dates from strings.

---

## Commonly Used Date and Time Format Codes

- `%a`: Abbreviated weekday name (e.g., Mon, Tue)
- `%A`: Full weekday name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday)
- `%b`: Abbreviated month name (e.g., Jan, Feb)
- `%B`: Full month name (e.g., January, February)
- `%d`: Day of the month (zero-padded) (e.g., 01, 02, 31)
- `%m`: Month as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 01, 02, 12)
- `%Y`: Year with century (e.g., 2024)
- `%H`: Hour (24-hour clock) (e.g., 00, 23)
- `%I`: Hour (12-hour clock) (e.g., 01, 12)
- `%M`: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 00, 59)
- `%S`: Second as a zero-padded decimal number (e.g., 00, 59)
- `%p`: AM or PM
- `%Z`: Time zone name (e.g., IST, UTC)
